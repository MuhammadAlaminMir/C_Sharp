# Introduction to C#

C# or C-Sharp is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework. It is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games, and more.

## Versatility of C#

C# is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to game development. It is a popular choice for developers due to its simplicity, readability, and powerful features.

## Key Features of C#

- **Statically/strongly Typed Language**: C# is a statically typed language, meaning the type is set while declaring the variable.
- **Compiled Language**: It is a compiled language, which means that the code is converted into machine code before it is executed.

**Object Oriented:** C# is an object oriented programming language, which makeds development and maintenance easier.  

**C# is a case sensitive language:**  which means you cant write class in upper case (Class), this will give an error. 

**Compiler-based Language** That means after writing the code, you require to complite the program in order execute it.

## History of C#

The first version of C# was released in the year 2002, and the latest version is C# 13.0, which was released in November 2024.

C# programming language is developed by Andres Hejlsberg.
## Multi-Paradigm Support

C# is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports multiple programming paradigms, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Functional Programming**
- **Imperative Programming**
